# ARA
1. datasets.txt contains links to used datasets.
2. Weights for models are located in Realises.

Website source code is located within website/streamlit

For the website you should have all the python libraries installed from requirements.txt (numpy, pandas, base64, streamlit etc.) install them through pip or by parsing requirements.txt

To start the website locally run bash command "streamlit run main.py"

Ignore all the rest directories, we did not delete them to ensure that you see we only changed readme and nothing else

To reiterate
1. CV models are within models zip
2. datasets are within datasets.txt
2. Website is at website/streamlit

The rest is just garbage
